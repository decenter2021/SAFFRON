### Synthesis
<p align="justify">
A store-and-forward urban road network can be synthesized seamlessly with SAFFRON by filling a custom spreadsheet. A template is provided in a <a href=https://github.com/decenter2021/SAFFRON/tree/master/ModelTemplate>subfolder</a> of the repository. The following data is input in the spreadsheet:
</p>

- the number of junctions ![$J$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}J), links ![$Z$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}Z), and stages ![$S$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}S), control cycle ![$C$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}C), simulation cycle ![$T$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}T), and the upstream gating parameter ![$c_ug$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}c_{ug})
- the lost time and number of stages in each junction 
- the capacity, saturation flow, number of lanes, initial number of vehicles, and demand flow for each link
- the minimum green time and historic green time of each stage
- the stage matrix ![$\mathbf{S}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}\mathbf{S}), *i.e.*, a table that indicates which links have right of way (r.o.w.) for each stage
- the turning rates matrix ![$\mathbf{T}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}\mathbf{T}), *i.e.*, a table that indicates the probability of turning into the links of the network on the exit of a certain link, and the exit rate of all links ![$\mathbf{t_0}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\color{gray}\mathbf{t_0})

<p align="justify">
Each table of the spreadsheet has to copied and pasted to <i>txt</i> whose names are indicated next to each table in the spreadsheet. These <i>txt</i> files have to be enclosed in a folder with the name of the urban road model. Template <i>txt</i> files and an example of this procedure are provided in a <a href=https://github.com/decenter2021/SAFFRON/tree/master/ModelTemplate>subfolder</a> of the repository.
</p>

The model is loaded into MATLAB making use of the following command 
```
>> model = SFMSynthesis("directory")
```
<p align="justify">
where <tt>directory</tt> is the enclosing folder of the <i>txt</i> files and <tt>model</tt> is a <i>MATLAB struct</i> object that characterizes the urban road network. The command above also saves the model object, as well as the raw input tables, in the file <i>data.txt</i> in the model folder. Thus afterwards the models can also be loaded using</p>

```
>> model = load("directory/data.mat")
```

The **fields** of store-and-forward model object *struct* are 

| Field      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| a      | b       |
| b   | a        |



>Example: *Load the Chania urban road network provided in SAFFRON*
>```
>>> chania = SFMSynthesis('ChaniaUrbanRoadModel')
>>> chania.S
> ans = 
>     42
